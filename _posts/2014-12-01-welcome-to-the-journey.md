Fellow Wayfarers,

You are dreamers, artisans, and difference-makers. You are creatives, entrepreneurs, and adventurers. You are believers in the world's best future.

**Welcome to our community blog.**

Consider this part travel guide and part travel journal. It might also be an exercise in cartography, creating maps for our fellow travelers as they navigate lives of adventure and awe.

Let's point a way to a life that matters, where we don't need to turn off our strengths and passions as we work to put food on the table and live generously. Let's birth ideas into restorative movements that make our neighborhoods and cities places where children can laugh and play--where the most vulnerable among us thrive.

**Let's truly live.**

I was just struck with immense gratitude that I get to write these words to you because almost five years ago, as I sensed a growing discontent in myself and many others for the values of comfort, superficiality, and stuff, I envisioned being part of a community that would fight back with new values for adventure, meaning, and unburdened lives. If you're reading this and resonating with it, that community includes you.

Whether you're part of our growing coworking and event space here in Costa Mesa or connecting from another city, you're invited to this dialogue. In addition to recapping our shared adventures, this blog will equip you with startup and productivity insights, resources and tools from our partners, and gleanings from our learning events.

**I'm glad you've found us.**

For the common good,<br>
Jeff
