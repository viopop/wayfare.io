The greatest thing about working for Wayfare is that we get to help people help others. The not so great part is that when we want to sleep, our brains still want to work. It's obvious, but without sleep none of those incredible projects are going to get done.

So why aren't we sleeping? The exciting projects, of course. And coffee. You smiled a little when you read that word, huh? Then you were angry that I implied a correlation between that sweet cup of happiness and your run in with insomnia. Just hang tight a bit before you throw your laptop at me.

Coffee may be the only thing keeping you from turning into the Incredible Hulk in the morning, but before you overdo it on your cup of Bruce Banner, take a second to monitor how much you've had. Sure we'll admit what happens when we haven't had coffee, but we don't often talk about what happens when we've had too much. Personally, I  go from productive to a jittery mess, knocking things over and typing emails with caps lock on. But let's not get crazy; I'm not saying no to coffee. In fact, I'm praising it and also suggesting a tool to help you enjoy it more--the UP Coffee app from Jawbone.

Let me break it down. Too much coffee = no sleep. Not enough coffee = sleep---but at inappropriate times like on your keyboard or your breakfast burrito. UP Coffee helps us find balance between what it calls "sleep ready" and "wired."

By tracking how much coffee we put in our caffeine riddled bodies, Up Coffee can tell us when to stop consuming. The result is a much more relaxed evening and a great night's sleep. Find it in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/up-coffee/id828031130?mt=8">the app store</a>, and while you're at it, check out Jawbone's other great health technology.
