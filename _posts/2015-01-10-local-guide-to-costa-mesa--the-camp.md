One of my favorite places in Costa Mesa is the CAMP. The CAMP has it all: unique and healthy dining, fun shops and boutiques, yoga classes, mouth-watering dessert, art walks, and even a "treehouse" for documentary screenings and events.

Getting to the CAMP alone is a poetic experience. You probably parked your car in front of a giant wall that spells "community", and your parking space likely gave you inspirational advice to "dive in and be free", and "say hello to others". As you walk into the CAMP, you are greeted by the sounds of birds chirping, vintage trailers renovated into little shops, and you may have even lounged in a massive hammock while you waited for your Vietnamese food conveniently served on a french baguette (cue in East Borough restaurant. I promise you don't want to miss it).

As you walk through the CAMP, you'll see a hub of mailboxes with restaurant menus inside, chairs and benches you wish were in your backyard, and a photo opportunity in every wall and corner. Make sure to bring your camera!

As if that wasn't enough, you'll want to stock up on all of your friend's (and probably even your dog's) birthday gifts at SEED People's Market. These gifts are sure to awe anyone with good taste&mdash;from ceramic mugs to beard wax, to jewelry made out of upcycled keys and everything in between. They take pride in their slogan "products with a purpose", and strive to sell only the best products that support local artisans, world-changing social enterprises, and eco-responsible brands that value sustainability.

After your shopping, you'll probably be ready for an authentic Italian gelato from Vitaly, or if you're feeling really adventurous&mdash;maybe even an octopus or buffalo chicken taco from Taco Asylum.

Be sure to come back on a Saturday for live music, or the last Tuesday of the month for their monthly local art walk. The CAMP celebrates those that live adventurously, creatively, and with purpose... and we love it for that.
