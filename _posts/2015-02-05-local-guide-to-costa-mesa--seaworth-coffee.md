The Wayfare co-working community loves its coffee. It is our fuel for productivity and an instrument for community. We are always interested in the opportunity to try out new local coffees, so today I'd like to introduce to you my favorite local cold brew: the Seaworth Single Fin Sludge.

The first time I was introduced to a "Single Fin Sludge" was at my favorite local brunch spot, Haute Cakes. I'm a sucker for a good cold brew, but being the resourceful collector that I am, I really just loved the thought of repurposing the amazing glass bottle (there, I said it).

That was until I tasted it. I did what the barista suggested and added some milk and Seaworth's infamous coconut simple syrup. I don't want to get all dramatic here, but that rich and buttery taste was love at first sip. It also doesn't hurt that it has about four times the caffeine than your average cup of joe!

Apart from it's impeccable flavor, I love Seaworth because it started right here in Costa Mesa. They realized that hot coffee on ice just doesn't cut it after a surf on a summer day, and hence the Single Fin Sludge was born. All of their products and materials are all-natural and sourced within 45 miles of Orange County, and then roasted and bottled right here overlooking the Newport Peninsula.

If you would like to try a Single Fin Sludge for yourself, you can try it at any of these local businesses: Haute Cakes Caffe, Greenleaf, Almond Surfboards, Mother's Market, Seabirds Kitchen, Porro Vita, A-Market, and Baking Bettys. You might just also find Seaworth in your glass at one of our upcoming events!

Thanks, Seaworth, for using your creative gifts to make Costa Mesa a better (and more delicious) place.
