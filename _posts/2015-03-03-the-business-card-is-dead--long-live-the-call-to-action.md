I used to carry business cards---lots of them. I'd exchange them with people at conferences and during meeting introductions. Instead of actually communicating with each other again, though, I regret to say a lot of business card passing was just an outdated exercise in corporate traditionalism.

"I might as well have just handed you a quarter, but instead, here's a reminder of my name and inflated title." Anything important or actionable was directly entered into our phones.

Ok, maybe I'm being too harsh on myself and those people who I never heard from again. Maybe not.

Then this morning as one of our startup incubator participants asked, "So I should get business cards, right?" (Natural question. It's just what you do). I found myself saying, "No, what you need is a call to action card." It flowed as if I consciously knew what I was saying.

Then I realized we recently made a call to action card (without thinking to call it that) for prospective Wayfare coworking members. We created this small square card with the following call to action:

"Come visit Wayfare for an introductory day of pure, coworking greatness."

With a short description to reinforce a core brand statement, which includes references to coffee and fixing the broken world, we included our location, email address, and phone number, along with a unique, one-time use code on each card.

Now, when I meet someone who fits our coworking demographic (independent creative, entrepreneur, or early stage organization), instead of giving them a me-centered business card, I hand them one of these cards that's focused on their needs.

I tell them we'd love to have them check out our space, and then I record their name on a spreadsheet that corresponds with their unique card code so we can measure the effectiveness of our efforts.

Some other effective examples of call to action cards I've seen:

"Bring in this card to enjoy a cup of coffee on us."

"Use this promo code for 20% of your next order before Christmas."

"Post a photo of this card on Instagram to receive a free one-month subscription."

It could even be as simple as "Join the conversation at wayfare.io/blog" or "Follow us on Instagram and Twitter @wayfarehq."

The key question to ask is: What call to action can I use that meets a real need for my target audience? Jump over to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WayfareHQ), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/wayfarehq/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wayfarehq) to share your ideas.

Oh, and one last call to action. I'm holding the card with one-time code **WF76811** in my back pocket. The first reader to contact us with the code receives one free introductory day of pure, coworking greatness here at Wayfare HQ.

Who's in?
