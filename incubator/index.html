      <h2>We love great ideas almost as much as we love coffee. What do we like even more? Ideas in action.</h2>
      <h2>Our goal is to build a space, community, resources, and paths for ideas to take life through you. To that end, we're creating a startup incubator program to serve leaders with world-changing ideas for both the non-profit and for-profit spaces&mdash;and everywhere in between.</h2>
      <h2>Contact us if you're interested. We'll begin piloting the program with a select few leaders in 2015.</h2>
